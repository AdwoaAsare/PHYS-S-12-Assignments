## About Me...

My name is **Adwoa Asare**, and I am a senior in highschool. I participate in activites such as _FIRST Robotics_ and _Science Fair_. In the past I have been really into programming and I aspire to be a computer engineer when I grow up. Through this course I intend to learn more about the electronics side of computing so I will be able to apply it to my current endeavors.
