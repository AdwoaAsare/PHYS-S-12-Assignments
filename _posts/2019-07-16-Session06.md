### Modeling in 3 Dimensions

Fusion 306 allows to make 3d shapes in two ways. You can either take a two dimenional sketch and extrude or rotate it, or you can work directly in 3 dimensions.

I wanted to make something small to print so that I could learn how to use the printers quickly. I designed the following pendant on Fusion 360 using a sphere and a torus.

I uploaded the stl file onto Cura and tried to print it, but once it got to the torus part of the print the printer nozzle kept hitting it and kocking the print around resulting in this unfinished print.

I decided to make a new model that would be easier to successfully print. I used a cube base because it would be sturdier and harder for the nozzle to knock around as it made movements in the x-y plane.

That reulted in this much more successful print.

When 3D printing anything with overhangs like what I was doing, it is important to have supprts to hold the structure up so it doesn't droop during printing. A really good example of that can be seen in the following print where the supports are use to hold up this frogs head.

We can also do 3D scanning to make models and then print them like with this block.

I made a 3D model of my head by having the scanner held at a set position and rotationg my body using a swivel chair.  <a href='myBust.stl' download>Click to download my STL file</a>

I tried printing this a couple times, but it didn't work out.
