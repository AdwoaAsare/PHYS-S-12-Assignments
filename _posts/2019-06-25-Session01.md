### Final Project Proposal

I like to grow plants. Unfortunately, I am rather poor at keeping plants alive. I tend to over or underwater them and its especially hard to find someone to watch them while I am away. 

As a result I would like to make a **self-supported planter**. What I mean is that the planter will be able to determine how much water is in the soil, what temperature it is and what not, then based on user inputted conditions determine whether to open a valve and add more water or alert the user that the plant is recieving too much sun. I am hoping to make the planter solar powered so it can be kept sunning for a long amount of time.

Some materials I know I will probably use to use: 

- Solar panel
- Temperature Sensor 
- Humidity Sensor
- Arduino board
