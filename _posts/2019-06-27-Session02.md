### Arduino and LEDs

In today's lab I:
- made a circuit with an arduino uno
- sautered an arduino nano
- made a circuit with an arduino nano
- programmed an arduino nano

Materials needed:
- arduino nano
- arduino uno
- (3) 100 ohm resistors
- bread board
- plugin wires for bread board
-wire stripper
- 3 LEDs 
- sautering gun
- sauter
- usb to mini cable
- usb cable
- power source

### Arduino uno circuit


1. (2) Wires were stripped, one red and one black
2. The _black wire_ was connected to the **ground (GND)** plugin on the arduino uno
3. The _red wire_ was connected to the **5v** output on the arduino uno
4. The wires and components were plugged into the breadbord as shown:

<!-- insert picture and diagram here -->

This idea can be expanded by adding another LED in parallel:

### Arduino Nano Circuit

1. The arduino ono parts were placed on the breadboard for stablization then sautered on
