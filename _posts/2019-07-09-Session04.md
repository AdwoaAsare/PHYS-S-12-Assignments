### Laser Cutter & 2D CAD


The goal of this lab was to make a press-fit kit out of cardboard. The pieces for the pressfit kit were designed in Autodesk Fusinon 360 which can be downloaded [here](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) for free.

For those new to this process, instructions for how to use fusion 360 and the laser cutter can be found on the [course website.](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/03_cutting/index.html)

### Press-Fit Kit

For my press fit kit I made the following the following sketch staring with the circle (40 cm diameter) and adding 4 construction lines through the center to the edges. i then made an offset from each of the lines(2.3 cm) and mirrored the off the offset lines. Once this was complete, I projected the parts of the sketch that I wanted to keep for cutting by 4 cm and turned the face of the now 3D image into my DXF file which you can access below.

After my DXF file was saved onto a USB drive i inserted the USB into the laser printer and followed standard procedure to use it. I cut out four pieces for my press fit kit as shown below.

### Laser Cutting

Here you can see a video of the laser cutter in action on the setting shown below. It is filling in a rectangular shape and due to the spacing setting there are visible gaps between each stroke of the laser.
