### RGB String LEDs

<img src="rainbow.JPG" alt="rainbow">

For my output device I was using a string of LEDs controlled with an Arduino UNO that output red, green, and blue values (also white) to create a variety of colors. These LEDs use the adafruit neopixel library: `#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>` . To download this library on Arduino Desktop: Tools>>Manage Libraries>> search Adafruit Neopixel and select the one by Adafruit.

As seen in the image, the left (black) wire of the LED string goes to ground, the middle (yellow) goes to digital pin 6, and the right (red) goes to 5v. Then for the temperature sensor look at [this page](https://adwoaasare.github.io/PHYS-S-12-Assignments/12/) of my website for a diagram and instructions on how to wire a temperature sensor (we use 5v, Analog pin 0, and Ground.

The goal of this program was to make the LEDs change color based on the temperature like a mood ring. To achieve this i used the following code to map the temperature to the RGB values you can download this Arduino code here. <a href='OutputDevices.ino' download>Click to download my ino (arduino) file</a>.

```
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN        6 
#define NUMPIXELS 10 
#define DELAYVAL 500 // Time (in milliseconds) to pause between pixels

int tempSensor = 0;

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels first
  strip.setBrightness(50); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)

}//void setup()

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  strip.clear();

  //getting the voltage reading from the temperature sensor
 int reading = analogRead(tempSensor);  
 
 // multiply by 5v to convert that reading to voltage, for 3.3v arduino use 3.3
 float voltage = reading * 5.0;
 voltage /= 1024.0; 
 Serial.print(voltage); Serial.println(" volts");
 
 // Celcius temperature
 float temperatureC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100 ;  //converting from 10 mv per degree with 500 mV offset to degrees ((voltage - 500mV) times 100)
 Serial.print(temperatureC); Serial.println(" degrees C");
 
 //Fahrenheit
 float temperatureF = (temperatureC * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32.0;
 Serial.print(temperatureF); Serial.println(" degrees F");

 int color = (int) map(temperatureF, 60, 100, 0, 255);
 Serial.print("Color Val: "); Serial.println(color);
 for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...

    // strip.Color() takes RGB values, from 0,0,0 up to 255,255,255
    // Here we're using a moderately bright green color:
    strip.setPixelColor(i, color, color/2, 255-color);

    strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.

    delay(DELAYVAL); // Pause before next pass through loop
  }//for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++)
 
 delay(1000); //wait one second before next reading              

}//void loop()
```

It's hard to see the color change in the video because I couldn't make large temperature changes easily in the lab, but you can see the color fade from a true blue color to a more purple color as I put my fingers over the temperature sensor.
