### Progress

This is a cardboard prototype of what the pot is going to look like.
It will have three levels: the soild container, the water container, and the electronics container in that order from top to bottom. The electronics container is put on the bottom for easy access and that is where the holders for the pump will be. The wiring for the pot will be on the outside with copper tracing done on the viynl cutter and the pot itself will be made out of acrylic so it can hold water for a long time without corroding.

Right now I can turn the pump on and off and get temperature readings from a sensor. My next steps electrical wise will be getting a soil moisture sensor and a humidity sensor and building a water level sensor for the water storage(using capacitors). After that I willset the temperature, humidity, and water moisture to display to an LCD screen.

### Steps

WaterPump:
1. Solder the **water pump**. Connect the red wire to the terminal with the red dot next to it.
2. Apply heat-shrink around the connections between the pump and the wiring.
3. The pump needs to have its positive terminal connected to the 5V output on the arduino and its negative terminal connected to drain on the transistor.
4. The ground of the transistor should be connected to the digital 3 pin on the arduino and the source should be connected to the ground of the arduino

Temperature Sensor:
1. The left pin of the temperature senor needs to be connected to 5V
2. The middle pin needs to be connected to be connected to analog pin 0
3. The right pin needs to be connected to ground
