### Cutting, Drilling, Joining 

Box Cutter:
The box cutter was used to cut cardboard into 40 x 60 cm rectangles that would fit into the lab's laser cutter. When using the box cutter, it was important to stand out of the way of the blade sice the way it is made requires you to cut towards yourself. It was also important to have a sacrificial layer underneath the cardboard we were cutting so that the table would remain unscrathed. It was necessary to apply a decent amount of pressure to cut through all the layers of the cardboard in one go. We also clamped the cardboard to the table to keep it from sliding.

Saws:
There were two main kinds of saws: push saws and pull saws. Push saws are more abraisive to the material you are cutting on the push stroke and pull saws are more abraisive on the pull stroke. This can be observed by the amount of force you have to use depending on the stroke and also the amount of material removed. When sawing it was important for us to secure the materials we were cutting (wooden rods and acrylic rods) by using clamps that held the materials to the side of the table.  For safety reasons, we kept our fingers clear of the saw and the materiall that was being cut.

Drills:
 Depending on the shape and size of the object being cut as well as the level of precision needed, it may be necessary to use a drill press or a hand drill.
